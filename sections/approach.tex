All News,Blogs and Tweets are first searched for the phrases learned. Then the filtered documents are searched for the presence of a reference to a Future Date. In case of News/blogs we search for the Presence of a reference to a Future Date only within the sentence where the phrase was found to reduce error. For tweets, we search the entire tweet for the reference of a future date.

Then, finally, a warning/alert is issued for those documents which contains a location information. In the case of tweets, we found that issuing an alert from just one tweet lead to a lot of wrong alerts. We thus, further filter the tweets by setting a threshold (set to 5) on the number of re-tweets of the tweet under consideration.

Each Individual step is discussed in detail below.

\subsection{classification}
For News/Blogs and Facebook, we make use of Text Based Naive Bayes Classifier to identify the event-type and population. Unigram and Bi-gram word features are used for training the classifier.

For Twitter, as we send alerts based on a single tweet, we chose the event-type and population based on prior likelihood for that location.
