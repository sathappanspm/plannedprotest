We evaluate the model using metrics as desccribed in our paper \cite{embersKDD}.In short, four our evaluation an event can be matched to an alert if the alert and the GSR event's locations are within a 300 KM radius and the forecasted event date lies within a given interval of the true event date. The Haversine Formula, is used to calculate the distance between two lat-lon points.
$$\operatorname{haversine}\left(\frac{d}{r}\right) = \sin^2(\frac{\phi_2 - \phi_1}{2}) + \cos(\phi_1) \cos(\phi_2) \sin^2(\frac{\lambda_2-\lambda_1}{2}) $$


We evaluate the model against different matching intervals ranging from 0 to 7. If $x$ is the allowed interval, then a matching can happen only if an alert's forecasted event date is within $+x$(upper bound) days of the GSR event and the lower bound is the minimum of the interval $x$ or the day difference between the two dates -\emph{GSR Event Date , Predicted Event Date}. A location score (LS), date score (DS) and an overall Quality Score (QS) is defined accordingly to establish the quality of date and location predictions and the combined quality of an alert. The definitions are outlined below,

\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{LS}=1 - min(|E_L-W_L|, 300)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{DS}=1 - min(|E_t-W_t|, \operatorname{INTERVAL})
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{QS}= (LS + DS)*2
\end{equation}

where E denotes a GSR event and W denotes a warning/alert.

%\text{$E_l$ is the Event location and $W_l$ is the warning location and their difference is the }


\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Perfomance over the months}
\end{itemize}
    Fig.~\ref{fig:monthlyqs} provides the evaluation results of the model over the months with a source level breakdown. The QS reported is the weighted average of QS of all 10 countries where the weight for a country is the number of GSR events for that country.
    Twitter has a higher QS as multiple re-tweets of mention of future events in twitter is a direct indicator of the popularity of an event as well as the intent of people to join an event. While mention of Future events in News is simply a reporting of the event not much can be understood about the popularity of the event or about the people's support for the event. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Country-wise perfomance}
\end{itemize}
    Table~\ref{tb:sourcewisecomparison} presents the perfomance of the planned protest model (for March 2014) for each of the 10 countries of interest. It also presents a source wise breakdown.From the table it is evident that different data source prefer different countries. The News/Blogs data source produces alerts for most countries and also provides much higher recall as opposed to twitter which provides High QS but very little recall.Also News/Blogs has a higher lead-time of 4.57 days as compared to twitters 2.82.

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Case Study: Venezuelan and Brazilian Protests}
\end{itemize}
The recent Venezuelan protests against President Nicolas Maduro and the Brazilian Protests during June 2013 against bus fare hike were two significant protests during our period of evaluation. Fig.~\ref{fig:venezuela_feb}\ref{fig:brazil_june} show how well the planned protest model was able to predict the unfolding of events under both situations. Fig.~\ref{fig:venezuela_violent} showcases the ability of the model to forecast the violent events also.

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Lead-Time vs Quality Trade-Off}
\end{itemize}

Fig.~\ref{fig:leadTimeVsQS} shows that the QS of the planned protest model increases with time. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Perfomance under stringent matching Criteria}
\end{itemize}
Fig.~\ref{fig:matchinginterval} shows the perfomance of the model when the matching window is varied from 7 to 1 in steps. We can see that the model is not affected badly even under the strict matching interval of 1-day difference.

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Quality Score Distribution}
\end{itemize}
The hump on the right side of the Fig.~\ref{fig:doubleHump} signifies that a majority of the planned protest alerts are high quality.
