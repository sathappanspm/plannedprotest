In Key Phrase Extraction, an input document is searched for the presence of one or more key phrases obtained in a semi-automatic manner as detailed in the following section. 

Each key phrase mostly consists of atleast two words.
The presence of a keyphrase is checked by searching for the presence of individual words of the keyphrase within the same sentence separated by utmost $n$ words, where $n$ is the average distance between the keyphrase words in the learning phase.

\subsection{classification}
For News/Blogs and Facebook, we make use of Text Based Naive Bayes Classifier to identify the event-type and population. Unigram and Bi-gram word features are used for training the classifier.

For Twitter, as we send alerts based on a single tweet, we chose the event-type and population based on prior likelihood for that location.
