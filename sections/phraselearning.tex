\sathappanc{Intro written for KDD paper}
Initially, a few seed phrases were obtained manually
with the help of subject matter experts. These phrases were parsed
using a dependency parser and the grammatical relationship between the
core subject word---{\em protest}, {\em manifestaci√≥n}, {\em Huelga},
etc.---and any accompanying word -- {\em plan}, {\em call}, {\em anunciar} --- was extracted. To extend the initial set of phrases, a set of sentences/tweets containing a subject word and a
future time/date expression was collected and parsed.  This set of
sentences was used to expand the set of planned protest phrases by
extracting all keyword combinations that have the same grammatical
relation with respect to the core subject word. The final set of
planned protest phrases is then obtained after a manual revision of
the phrases obtained in the last step.

By this approach, we learned 122 phrases for News/blogs and 186 for tweets.
