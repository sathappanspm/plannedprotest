To extract the protest location from news articles, we use \emph{probabilistic soft logic} (PSL) \cite{broecheler:uai10;kimmig:probprog12} to build a model that performs robust, probabilistic inference given noisy signals. PSL takes a set of weighted, logic-like rules and converts them into a continuous probability distribution over the unknown truth values of logical facts. These truth values in PSL are relaxed into the $[0,1]$ interval. We use this mechanism to build a model that infers the semantic location of an article by weighing evidence coming from the Basis entity extractions and information in the World Gazatteer. 

The primary rules in the model encode the effect that Basis-extracted location strings that match to gazatteer aliases are indicators of the article's location, whether they be country, state, or city aliases. Each of these implications is conjuncted with an prior for ambiguous, overloaded aliases that is proportional to the population of the gazetteer location. For example, if the string ``Los Angeles'' appears in the article, it could refer to either Los Angeles, California, or Los \'{A}ngeles in Argentina or Chile. Given no other information, our model would infer a higher truth value for the article referring to Los Angeles, California, because it has a much higher population than the other options. 

The secondary rules, which are given half the weight of the primary rules, perform the same mapping of extracted strings to gazetteer aliases, but for extracted persons and organizations. Strings describing persons and organizations often include location clues (e.g., ``mayor of Buenos Aires''), but intuition suggests the correlation between the article's location and these clues may be lower than with location strings. 

Finally, the model includes rules and constraints to require consistency between the different levels of geolocation, making the model place higher probability on states with its city contained in its state, which is contained in its country. As a post-processing step, we enforce this consistency explicitly by using the inferred city and its enclosing state and country, but adding these rules into the model makes the probabilistic inference prefer consistent predictions, enabling it to combine evidence at all levels.
