%

Three categories of related work -- \emph{Event Detection, Extraction of Planned Events and  Event Forecasting} -- are briefly discussed here.

First, Event Detection/Extraction from textual News has been studied extensively in literature.A lot of them make use of document clustering techniques \cite{Allan:2002:TDT} \cite{Yang:1998:SRO}\cite{Gabrilovich:2004:NPP}to identify events either retrospectively or as the stories arrive.\cite{Chambers:2011:TIE},\cite{Banko07openinformation}, \cite{Riloff:2003:LEP} talk about extraction patterns/templates to extract information from Text. \cite{Ritter:2012} is one of the first papers to show it's possible to accurately extract a calendar of significant events from Twitter by training a tagger for recognizing event phrases.\cite{Becker:2012:ICP}, \cite{Becker_automaticidentification} deal with identifying content for already known planned events from Social Media.\cite{Sankaranarayanan:2009:TNT} captures tweet clusters of interest to identify late breaking News from twitter. In an altogether different application \cite{Sakaki:2010:EST} observes tweets to enable detection of occurences of Earth Quakes promptly.

Second, not much work is done regarding extraction of planned/future mentions of events from Social Media. Recorded Future\cite{recordedFuture} is an analytics company that performs real-time analysis of news and tweets to identify mentions of future events.\sathappanc{need to write more on how it is different from ours?}.In \cite{Becker:2012:ICP} and \cite{Becker_automaticidentification} content about known planned events is identified from Social Media.



Third, few work has been done in the area of Event Forecasting. \cite{Radinsky:2013:MWP}, is one of the first papers in this category. The paper learns event sequences from a corpora spanning over 22 years and then uses these sequences to forecast events like disease outbreaks, deaths and riots.It only predicts if an event of interest will happen in the future given the sequence of events seen but it does not predict when/where(city level) that event will happen. In \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Kallus14}, the author makes use of data from Recorded Future to find if a  significant protest event will occur in the next three days or not usig a random forest classifier.The author only focuses on prediction of significant events and also the forecast is limited to the next three days.\cite{compton2013detecting} and \cite{xu2014civil} are two pieces of research  that are very close to our line of work. Both papers follow similar methodologies but are based on different datasets--Twitter and Tumblr.In \cite{compton2013detecting}, a list of 335 keywords identified by experts is used to filter twitter stream and the filtered twitter streams are then searched for the presence of future dates in a naive manner by first searching for month names and then for a number less than 31. Such an approach, will not be capable of finding relative mentions of future dates like "tomorrow", "next tuesday" etc. If any location is mentioned in the text of the tweet it is used as the event location else the location is determined based on a in-house geocoder\cite{hrlgeocoder}.\cite{xu2014civil} works on Tumblr and makes uses of a fewer set of keywords(59) to filter the Tumblr feed. The filtered feed is further refined by searching for mentions of around 1022 different location names.Finally, the documents are searched for a future date in the same way as in \cite{compton2013detecting}.
