%        {\em Date}: Quoting "Our future dates is done."Our future date filter searches first for month names and abbreviations in Spanish and Portuguese and second for numbers less than 31 within three whitespace separated tokens from each other.

%        {\em Event Geocoding}: If no location in Text then location of retweeter is used based on HRL's Geocoding methodology.
%
%        {\em EventType and Population}: Duplicate Forecasts for same date/location are combined into one and then tweet history of every tweeter/retweeter in the forecast are searched for keywords pertaining to particular classes identified by domain expert and then most commonly occuring class is assigned.

Three categories of related work -- \emph{Event Detection, Extraction of Planned Events and  Event Forecasting} -- are briefly discussed here.

First, Event Detection/Extraction from textual News has been studied extensively in literature.A lot of them make use of document clustering techniques \cite{Allan:2002:TDT} \cite{Yang:1998:SRO}\cite{Gabrilovich:2004:NPP}to identify events either retrospectively or as the stories arrive.\cite{Chambers:2011:TIE},\cite{Banko07openinformation}, \cite{Riloff:2003:LEP} talk about extraction patterns/templates to extract information from Text. \cite{Ritter:2012} is one of the first papers to show it's possible to accurately extract a calendar of significant events from Twitter by training a tagger for recognizing event phrases.\cite{Becker:2012:ICP}, \cite{Becker_automaticidentification} deal with identifying content for already known planned events from Social Media.\cite{Sankaranarayanan:2009:TNT} captures tweet clusters of interest to identify late breaking News from twitter. In an altogether different application \cite{Sakaki:2010:EST} observes tweets to enable detection of occurences of Earth Quakes promptly.

Second, not much work is done regarding extraction of planned/future mentions of events from Social Media. Recorded Future\cite{recordedFuture} is an analytics company that performs real-time analysis of news and tweets to identify mentions of future events.\sathappanc{write more on how it is different from ours?}.In \cite{Becker:2012:ICP} and \cite{Becker_automaticidentification} content about known planned events is identified from Social Media.



Third, weIn \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Kallus14}, the author makes use of data from Recorded Future to find if a  significant protest event will occur in the next three days or not usig a random forest classifier.
Three different categories of related work - \emph{Event Detection, Event Forecasting, } is discussed. There has been a lot of work done in the field of Event Detection--Oren Etzioni, Online Event Detection. Most of these deal with detection of event from Multiple documents. But here, we deal with detection/identification of event reportings specially mentions of future events in particular. Some work has been done targeting planned Event detection like HRL's paper, Identifying Content for Online Events etc. In both the HRL papers they search for a single keyword to forecast events. Searching for one keyword can lead to false results. We propose a high precision event identification system through the use of phrases as opposed to keywords. We also provide a semi-automatic method to identify relevant key-phrases. 
Thirdly, little work is done regarding forecasting civil unrest events {VT's paper, HRL paper, Nathan kallus's paper}. The planned Protest is a part of the EMBERS architecture and is discussed in detail here. It scours disparate social media sources on a real-time basis to identifying/detect mentions of future events. The Nathan Kallus's paper uses mentions of future events to forecast significant protests in a country. We deal with the problem identifying the future mentions of events.
